# Armstrong Number Checker üöÄ

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Menio30/Armstrong-Number.svg)

Welcome to the **Armstrong Number Checker** repository! This project helps you determine if a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the Armstrong number concept. It serves as a useful tool for educational purposes and helps you understand basic programming concepts. The implementation is straightforward and can be adapted to various programming languages.

## What is an Armstrong Number?

An Armstrong number is a number that can be expressed as the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example:

- **153**: 1¬≥ + 5¬≥ + 3¬≥ = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
- **9474**: 9‚Å¥ + 4‚Å¥ + 7‚Å¥ + 4‚Å¥ = 6561 + 256 + 2401 + 256 = 9474

In this project, we will focus on identifying such numbers in a given range.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Armstrong Number Checker, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Use the command below to clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Menio30/Armstrong-Number.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**: Change into the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd Armstrong-Number
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**: If there are any dependencies, install them using the package manager specified in the project.

## How to Use

Using the Armstrong Number Checker is simple. You can run the program and input a number to check if it is an Armstrong number. The program will provide you with the result.

### Example Command
```bash
python armstrong_checker.py 153
```

### Output
```
153 is an Armstrong number.
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how the program works:

- Input: `370`
  - Output: `370 is an Armstrong number.`
  
- Input: `123`
  - Output: `123 is not an Armstrong number.`

You can test various numbers to see if they qualify as Armstrong numbers.

## Installation

To run the program, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to install the necessary components:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
